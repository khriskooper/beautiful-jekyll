Officially, I’m a **Customer & Market Strategist**: I’ll maximise the revenues on your P&L and drive down costs of service by implementing targeted, strategically-designed interventions.

In reality, my career has been all about **Leading Complex Change** in a variety of contexts and 6 industries*. Whether the purpose of change was cultural, strategic, or technological, I've developed and applied strengths and tools that deliver results.

\* *those 6 industries are:* telecommunications, broadband, financial services, energy retail, geospatial/data, and the charitable/community sector.
